# FTPflow

`FTPflow` is a Python package for optimally traversing extremely large FTP directory trees.  It constitutes the algorithmic heart of the [Airport](https://github.com/airportbio/airport-web) search engine.  FTPflow creates a dictionary formatted as a JSON file in the userâ€™s home directory containing all the full paths as keys and the respective filenames as values.  FTPflow is designed with speed in mind by utilizing state-of-the-art high performance parallelism and concurrency algorithms to traverse FTP directory trees.  The resultant hash table (i.e., dictionary) supports fast lookup for any file in any biological database.
